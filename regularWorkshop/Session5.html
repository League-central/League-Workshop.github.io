                            <p>The recipe advises students to use <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/draw">Pixilart</a> to make a maze, but any simple image editor will work. If time is short, a pre-drawn maze is provided in the package, or students can find a suitable image on the Internet to drag and drop into the project. 
                            </p>

                                <li>The recipe uses color to determine which is the maze path and which is "out of bounds".</li>
                                <li>The path, background, and end zones must be different colors.</li>
                               <li>The path must be wide enough that you can navigate it using the mouse.</li>
                               <li>Don't make it too complex or it is difficult to play / test.</li>
