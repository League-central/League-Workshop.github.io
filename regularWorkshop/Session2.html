                                If any student did not clone the workshop code in Section 1, they need to do that now.<br><br>
                                Have the students clone their workshop repository, then start the Eclipse app (from the dock or on the desktop) and import the workshop Java project.
                            </p>

                                <li>Have students play around with their Robot, looking up commands and running the code to see what happens.</li>
