                                Sometimes a student enrolls in a workshop and they already have 6 months or more experience of writing Java code. If you have a student who demonstrates a level of mastery that may make the workshop unnecessary, you can offer them a Java Assessment:

                                <li>In a browser, have them fill out the <a href="http://bit.ly/LeagueAssess">Pre-Assessment Survey</a>.</li>
                                <li>Next, have the student take the <a href="http://level0.jointheleague.org/PlacementQuiz/">Placement Quiz</a>. </li>
                                <li>Look at which questions they got right / wrong</li>
                                <li>Record their score and add comments in Pike13 (if they have an account). Otherwise send info in an <a href="mailto:info@jointheleague.org">email to Info</a></li>
                                <li>If the student scored more than 10, they <u>might</u> be eligible to skip Level 0 (or more) of our program. Consult with Keith before talking to the student's parents.</li>
