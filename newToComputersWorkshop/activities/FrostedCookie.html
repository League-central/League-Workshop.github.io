                        Students write instructions for making a frosted cookie.  The teacher follows their instructions exactly with ridiculous results.  Students learn that computers only do exactly what you tell them to, and then English is imprecise.

                      Intro: Computers will only do exactly what you tell them to.  They aren’t smart enough to realize there is a problem.  You have to be the smart one and give them good instructions!  Imagine you were telling a person how to make a frosted cookie.  You might say “put the frosting on the cookie” and they’d know what you meant.  But if you told a computer that, you might get something like…(pick up the jar of frosting and put it on the package of cookies. Optionally, say “putting frosting on cookies” in a robotic voice).  Is that what you want?  So, we’re going to practice giving step-by-step instructions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                      Pass out pencils and paper and give students a few minutes to write instructions.  Put on gloves before touching the food.  Have a student read their instructions and follow their instructions exactly.
                      </p>
                      For example:
                      <ul>
                          <li>“Pick up the knife” -> pick the knife up without removing it from the ziplock bag</li>
                          <li>“Stick the knife in the frosting” -> attempt to jam the knife through the lid of the frosting if they didn’t remove the lid first</li>
                          <li>“Scoop out some frosting” -> assuming the lid is off, scoop it out with your hand</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>Give students time to revise their instructions, then repeat.</p>
                      <p>After a few minutes, tell the students that we’ve seen a few things: that we have to think about step-by-step instructions when we’re programming computers, that we’re going to be trying things and making mistakes and trying some more, and that the English language can be very unclear--so we’re going to be “talking” to computers in a language called Java!</p>
                      <p>Pass out frosted cookies.</p>
