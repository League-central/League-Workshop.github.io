                            At the whiteboard, review with students how to instantiate a robot and the
                            <code>penDown()</code>, <code>move()</code>, <code>turn()</code> methods.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Put students in pairs.  Tell students that they will take turns running code
                            and being the robot.  Have students work together to write robot code, then
                            one student will act out the move and turn commands.  They will then run
                            the code to see if they were corrrect.
