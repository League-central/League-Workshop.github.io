                              Do an example with students: roll one die and write the result in the first box.  Roll two dice and write the sum in the second box.
                              Walk through the code and figure out what will be printed.

                              Divide students into small groups and give each group a worksheet.  Ask them to work together to roll the dice,
                              fill out the worksheet, and figure out what the code will print.

                          Remind students of the three types of variables they have learned about.  Review how to declare and initialize a string.
                          Explain the <code>speak()</code> method, and relate it to calling <code>move()</code> or <code>turn()</code> but with a <code>String</code> parameter
                          instead of an <code>int</code> parameter.

                          Have students complete Stephen Hawking in zebra.section4 package.

                          Complete the Zombie Eyes recipe.  Starter code is provided to the students in package zebra.section4.
                          The instructions are the same as the usual Zombie Eyes recipe,
                           but images are included in the data folder (face0.jpg, face1.jpg, etc.)
                          so students can choose a face without having to use the internet.  Instructions for taking their own photo
                          using photobooth (will work on Macs) are included as an extra.

                            Make sure sound library is installed: "Tools" -> "Add tool..." -> "Libraries" Tab -> Filter for "sound"
                            If the "Sound" library has a green checkbox next to it, it is installed.
                            If it does not, click the library and click "Install"
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Tell students they will be making a game where two people can race
                              a dog and a cat across the screen by each tapping a keyboard button as fast as they can</li>
                              <li>Ask students to call <code>moveDog()</code> in the <code>setup()</code> method.
                              The dog will move just a tiny bit because the <code>setup()</code> method is called just once.</li>
                              <li>Ask students to move the call to <code>moveDog()</code> in the <code>draw()</code> method.
                              The dog will keep moving because the <code>draw</code> method is called repeatedly.</li>
                              <li>But, we don't want the dog to move constantly--we want it to move
                              only when we hit a button.  Explain that the <code>key</code> variable
                              keeps track of the last button that was hit, so we can write <code>if (key == 'a'){...}</code></li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Final code should have something like this in the <code>draw()</code> method:
                            <code> <pre>

  if (key == 'a'){
      moveDog();
  }
  if (key == 'l') {
      moveCat();
  }
                            </pre> </code>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Optional extra activities for students who finish early:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Change the background image</li>
                              <li>Make the animals move faster</li>
                              <li>Change the text that appears when someone wins</li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
